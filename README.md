## Inspiration
Most people aspire to develop a healthy fitness routine for the long run, yet a lot of us fail to do so. We lack the motivation to follow through our fitness goal because relying on willpower alone is simply not strong enough. Studies have shown that exercising with friends would increase the chances of sticking to one's exercise plan, and of course, it can make it more enjoyable and fun! This opportunity is, however, hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic as gyms across the world have been shut down in order to encourage people to stay at home and stay safe.

Unfortunately, while this does effectively slow the spread of COVID-19, it also has negative implications in other important areas of maintaining good health. Without the availability of gyms and the social aspect of exercising, it can be discouraging to work out. Therefore, we decided to create something to combat this issue.

## What it does
Fitogether is a social fitness app that allows users to work out virtually with friends and hold each other accountable via our seamlessly integrated health statistics. Our three main value proposition are that users can 1) easily workout virtually with friends with our built in workout videos & video call 2) track and share their progress instantly with their friends to stay motivated 3) hold each other accountable via our messaging platform. We believe that having virtual workout partners can help holding you accountable and ultimately allow you to achieve your fitness goal! We have made this process easier and simpler for users:
they can create an account and build their own Fitness Treasure Map complete with their personalized fitness goals. To create their goals, a user simply inputs the activity they want to participate in, how often they will do the activity, and for how long they want to pursue this goal. Users can also decide whether or not to allow their friends to see their goals and progress on the Settings page.

## Product Details
Users can check in on their progress and current goals at anytime by checking the Schedule tab. This tab also includes the week's upcoming and completed workouts along with a recommended workout based on previous workouts the user has participated in.

If the user wants a more in depth evaluation of their progress on Fitogether, they can check out the Your Progress tab which includes the amount of sessions and time the user has worked out. We also provide a an easy to follow pie chart that breaks down the exercises the user has been doing according to the work out routine category. Users can also view a monthly color coded calendar based off of these details.

With Fitogether, our main goal is motivation and socialization through pursuing fitness! So, one of our main services is offering users the opportunity to schedule workouts with their friends! This feature is designed so that users can work out together while watching the same tutorial. 

To help browse or find workouts that users are interested in, we created a Categories tab with various Workout Treasures including Abs, Back, and Biceps routines among others.

Another key feature is our chat option which allows users to communicate with each other directly from our program! This way, users can focus on the experience of working out with their friends through Fitogether rather than toggling between different applications.

## How we built it
- Google Cloud Platform's extremely secure database storage 

- High fidelity wireframe using Figma

- MongoDB is used to store the project in the Google Cloud Platform.

- Front-end development using React/Redux and MaterialUI

- Uses React hooks to manage React lifecycle.

- Uses Redux to manage state.

- Back-end development using node.js, mongoDB and express

- API endpoints are written using express.js.

- Database models are created using Mongoose.

- Web sockets

- Twilio

## Challenges we ran into
One of our biggest challenges was combining features we created in Twilio to the rest of the overall Fitogether project which was a different app.

To overcome this challenge, our team had to collaborate with each other and come up with different alternatives 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

## What we learned
- Pair programming and group discussions can be surprisingly effective at taking down difficult hurdles 5AM in the morning. 
- Web socket fundaments
- Basic web rtc + Twilio
- React 

## What's next for Fitogether


### `How to run the project`
Download all repos:

Webpages: https://github.com/darrenzhang2000/aye-aye-hacks-frontend/

Video Call service: https://github.com/connorcodes/twilio-video-app-react

Backend: https://github.com/darrenzhang2000/aye-aye-backend

Then, in command line for each project run "npm install". After that, you should be able to run "npm run build" for each project. From there, you can visit "localhost:XXXX" to enter the website, and that should provide linking to the other components.

In the video call portion, you will select a video from "categories" which will then load the video meeting. Sign in, and then anyone on your local network can join the call and watch the video with you. Each user will be able play/pause the video, and stop it whenever they want. Workout stats are tracked in your profile!




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
